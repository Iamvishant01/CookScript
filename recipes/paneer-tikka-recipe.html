<h1>Paneer Tikka Recipe</h1>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
For the Marinade:<br />
<br />
250g paneer (cottage cheese), cut into cubes<br />
1/2 cup thick yogurt (preferably Greek yogurt)<br />
1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste<br />
1 tbsp lemon juice<br />
1 tbsp red chili powder<br />
1 tsp turmeric powder<br />
1 tsp garam masala<br />
1 tbsp coriander powder<br />
1 tbsp cumin powder<br />
Salt to taste<br />
1 tbsp mustard oil (optional, for authentic taste)<br />
1 tbsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)<br />
1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro (optional)<br />
For the Tikka:<br />
<br />
1 onion, sliced into rings<br />
1 bell pepper, sliced into rings<br />
Fresh coriander or mint leaves (for garnish)<br />
Lemon wedges<br />
Instructions:<br />
Prepare the Marinade:<br />
<br />
In a mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder, salt, and mustard oil. Mix well until smooth.<br />
Add the paneer cubes to the marinade and coat them evenly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (for better flavor, marinate for 2-3 hours).<br />
Prepare the Skewers:<br />
<br />
While the paneer is marinating, prepare the vegetables (onion and bell pepper) by slicing them into rings.<br />
After marinating, thread the paneer cubes onto skewers, alternating with onion and bell pepper rings.<br />
Cook the Paneer Tikka:<br />
<br />
Option 1 (Grilling): Preheat a grill or oven to medium-high heat. Place the skewers on the grill and cook for 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally until the paneer is slightly charred and cooked through. You can brush the paneer with a little oil or butter during grilling to keep it moist.<br />
Option 2 (Stovetop): Heat a non-stick pan or grill pan over medium heat. Place the skewers on the pan and cook the paneer for 3-4 minutes on each side, turning until golden brown and slightly charred.<br />
Serve:<br />
<br />
Once the paneer is cooked, remove it from the skewers and place it on a serving plate.<br />
Garnish with fresh coriander or mint leaves, lemon wedges, and serve with a side of green chutney or yogurt dip.<br />
Enjoy your Paneer Tikka, a flavorful Indian appetizer that is both spicy and smoky!</p>
